import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup


# Making a GET request
r = requests.get('https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-programming-language/')

# check status code for response received
# success code - 200
print(r)

# Parsing the HTML
soup = BeautifulSoup(r.content, 'html.parser')
print(soup.prettify())

# is very similar to the requests library, but provides the output to 
# the terminal in a nicer format
